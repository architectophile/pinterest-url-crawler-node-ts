## Introduction

This is a sample project with `Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `ESLint` and `Prettier`. It contains basic building, development, and production environment settings for a Node.js with TypeScript application. You can use this as a reference implementation to get started building your Node.js with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier project. And you can also lint the code and fix it using `ESLint`. Check the scripts in `package.json` file for linting.

Using `Visual Studio Code(VS Code)` editor with `Prettier - Code formatter` extension is recommended to edit the source file to make the most of the combination of `ESLint` and `Prettier`.
